A scene in Unreal gets rendered from the point of view of a moving camera - in this case, a human visitor. A version of this setup is now common in "virtual stage" setups, but getting it right for realtime interaction requires very fast and accurate tracking in 3D.

I enjoyed getting a version of [Hyperpose](https://github.com/tensorlayer/HyperPose) compiled and running on a Nvidia Jetson Xavier - a single board computer with very powerful onboard AI/GPU hardware. I hooked up an industrial imaging camera from Basler to get the highest possible framerate.
