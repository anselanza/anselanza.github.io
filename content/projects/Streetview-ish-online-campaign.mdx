  On this project, I used A-Frame (a web **VR/AR** framework) in an unusual
  context: a fashion catalogue presented in a custom-built "streetview"-like

Interactive 3D graphics in the browser were new enough in 2019 to make this project an interesting technical challenge.

I worked in a team with two other web developers, and we wrote a lot of custom javascript on top of A-Frame's "component" system to develop a unique online experience.
