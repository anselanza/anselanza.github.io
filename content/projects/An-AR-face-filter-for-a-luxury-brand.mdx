This little application was part of a campaign for Chloe, a French fashion house specialising in bags and other accessories.

For this project, I learned to use Meta (then Facebook) Spark Studio, which is a surprisingly well-designed visual programming environment made built specifically for creating "face filters" and other Augmented Reality experiences in Instagram and Facebook.

I incorporated some custom 3D assets and shader programming to get the reflective look of the handbag clasp detail "just right". There was also some facial gesture recognition incorporated ("make a kissing face") to trigger animations.

I generally enjoy visual programming environments (though TouchDesigner sometimes drives me a bit crazy) and this was a great way to practise some realtime 3D and AR techniques in a project with simple requirements but very high aesthetic standards.
