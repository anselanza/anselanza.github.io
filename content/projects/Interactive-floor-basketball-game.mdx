This project was commissioned by Hennessy, who were sponsoring the NBA. They wanted an interactive floor that could be deployed "anywhere", from tiny popup stores to giant branded lounge bars.

I used my favourite GPU-accelerated 2D graphics library, [PixiJS](https://pixijs.com/) and a custom-built web audio engine built on top of [Howler](https://howlerjs.com/) to build a very dynamic-looking game that was also exceptionally easy to play.

I collaborated with graphic designers [Playground Paris](https://playgroundparis.com/) to produce a game that could literally be played by accident, allowing you to join in merely by walking onto the floor. Dynamically-assigned "AI" (computer-controlled) players would join the game as teammates dynamically to ensure an even match.

The test setup alone was enormous. I used a short-throw projector in our offices to produce a roughly 5mx6m floor to play on, and used our in-house 2D LIDAR tracking system to map the entire playing area. Because everything was browser-based and utilised [Tether](https://github.com/RandomStudio/tether) it was super simple to develop, simulate and test using a multi-touch display (an Android phone) or the full-size interactive floor setup.
