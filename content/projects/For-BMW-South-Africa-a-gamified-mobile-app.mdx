This mobile-first web application was built using AngularJS in the frontend and NodeJS on the backend. (This was before React had become popular.) I directed the design and copywriting process, as well as working with developers to create a beautiful HTML5 interface with lots of custom video and animations.

We also created a multi-player driving game that could be played on site for induction events. The main game application was built in Unity, and could be displayed on a projector; meanwhile, the players (new inductees) could remote control their cars using their own mobile devices, connected to a custom WiFi portal provided to the venue. A NodeJS server relayed communications between the phones and the Unity application.

This was a great experience in developing a full-stack application that combined a database, authentication, automated email campaigns and game development.
