There are too many projects from this period (Â±2006-2017) to list on my site: customer-facing and internal campaigns, events and product launches, banks and beer companies. They usually involved some kind of web technology (though seldom traditional "websites"), but also included electronics, computer vision, 3D graphics and even some Java development (especially in the context of Processing/p5).

What all these projects had in common was "multimedia" and "having fun with technology". I learned how to figure things out and get amazing things built, usually with very limited resources.

Some of the videos below are funny to watch now (since I typically edited and narrated them myself!) but I am proud of all the work my younger self managed to produce in what was sometimes very challenging circumstances.
