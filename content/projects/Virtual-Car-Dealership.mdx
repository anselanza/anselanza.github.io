The project was completed way back in 2014-2015, but the ambitious approach to interaction still stands out. To mention a few highlights: an industrial imaging camera doing realtime marker tracking with C++, a Kinect for exploring 3D models with gestures, custom Linux PCs and some cloud-based infrastructure bridging the installation to the dealership's CRM system. Everything on screen (iPad, table, video wall) was browser-based.
