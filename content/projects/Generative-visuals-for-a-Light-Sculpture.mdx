title: Generative visuals for a Light Sculpture

  I built a shareable browser-based prototype for designers, artists - and the
  client - to pre-visualise the light show for this interactive sculpture.

The sculpture was a kind of deconstructed 3D tomography of a prototype Lexus electric vehicle. It was exhibited outdoors at Miami Art & Design Week 2023. The project was a collaboration between solar design studio Marjan van Aubel and Lexus; my part was to help the Random Studio team figure out how the installation would work and what it could look like.

I turned to one of my favourite visual programming tools, [Cables.GL](https://cables.gl/), which allowed me to rapidly iterate on some **generative graphics**, and also - perhaps most importantly - allowed designers to try things out and share progress with production partners and the client.

I have always enjoyed these kinds of visual programming environments. Back in the day I built whole installations with Apple Quartz Composer. I also enjoy Max/MSP for a similar approach in audio, although I'm more partial to its stripped-down Open Source cousin, PureData. I have also used TouchDesigner a few times but absolutely loathe its ugly and weirdly-esoteric design, although I managed to produce some good working projects in spite of how much I dislike it.
