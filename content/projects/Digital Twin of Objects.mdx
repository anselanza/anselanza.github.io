This was an "experiment" or in-house research project, tentatively named "Digital Twin of Objects". The idea was to explore how to represent and interact with a digital mirror image of any object (e.g. a product) on screen.

This is not a new problem, but hardware solutions for precisely tracking objects in space - for example, using triangulation with radio, or enhanced GPS - tend to be complex and expensive. Some approaches make sense at large scale, outdoors (e.g. drones), but it gets very challenging when you need to track something small in a space that has no line-of-sight to GPS satellites.

On the technical side of this project, I devised a hybrid solution: Machine-Learning computer vision for positional tracking, and embedded IMU sensing for accurate rotation and fast movements (acceleration). I chose to use the [Oak-D](https://shop.luxonis.com/products/oak-d) camera so that I would be able to track in 3D (including "depth").

Working like this allowed the technologies to complement each other:

* IMU (accelerometers plus magnetometer/gyro)
  * STRENGTHS: Accurate and fast rotational data, highly sensitive for small movements (acceleration)
  * WEAKNESSES: Attempting to add acceleration over time for positional tracking ("dead reckoning") will inevitably drift
* Computer Vision (with aligned depth camera)
  * WEAKNESSES: Difficult to determine rotation of an object in any reliable way, especially for certain shapes.
  * STRENGTHS: A well-trained object recognition model should be able to determine bounds (in 2D) quickly and reliably. Any errors could be smoothed and filtered.

We had a fairly generic "oloid" shaped dummy object to experiment with. I embedded an ESP32 microcontroller and an [Adafruit 9-DOF sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2472) and powered it with a small Li-ion battery. Data was sent over WiFi using the [Tether](Tether-an-in-house-system-to-make-interactive-installations-easier) system I had helped to develop in-house.

I used YoloV6 as the basis for a custom-trained model.
