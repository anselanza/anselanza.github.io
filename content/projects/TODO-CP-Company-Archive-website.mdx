For CP Company's "Cinquanta" (50 year) anniversary, we created a prototype for their digital archive. I didn't have to build the final website, just prototype some of the more unusual interface elements.

For example, we proposed a dynamic transition effect when loading new sections, recalling film-photography in order to "reference the tactility of each artefact" (read [https://random.studio/projects/an-archival-experience-celebrating-c-p-companys-50th-anniversary](https://random.studio/projects/an-archival-experience-celebrating-c-p-companys-50th-anniversary) for more).

The challenge with all of these elements was to ensure that they could be faithfully reproduced for the real website. (This balance of playfulness and practicality is something I enjoy immensely.) The WebGL transitions were designed to work automatically for any of the hundreds of images that would be loaded into the system. A colour-picking algorithm found unique colours for every image, and some post-processing effects gave everything the same "look" regardless of the varied input. GPU acceleration was used throughout to ensure snappy performance.
