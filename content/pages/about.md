      # The Soft Skills


      ## Project Experience


      * Permanent and temporary installations

      * Window displays, popup stores, exhibitions, product launches

      * Prototype/experimental browser-based interfaces

      * Live events such as conferences, corporate “roadshows”

      * Prototype fixtures/spatial design concepts

      * Websites, games

      * Software tooling and reusable applications to support all of the above


      ## Team Roles


      Worked with: junior and senior developers, (executive) creative directors,
      (interaction, spatial, graphic) designers, project managers, artists,
      musicians, sound designers, (event) production companies, technicians,
      clients


      Worked as: developer, system architect, on-site installer, consultant,
      troubleshooter, mentor, manager, technical lead, (motion graphics, web)
      designer, sound designer, lighting designer, video editor, project
      manager, copywriter, network administrator, technical documentation writer


      ## Technology Niches


      Distributed computing architecture


      Embedded systems


      MQTT


      Audio: sound design, spatial audio, generative, music


      Rust for WGPU, Desktop UI, MQTT


      Web development, including for non-web applications (PWA, graphics, data
      visualisation)


      2D WebGL / WebGPU


      Low-power sustainable tech


      Multi-user game development


      # The Hard Skills


      ## Programming Languages and Frameworks


      * TypeScript (React especially on the frontend, NodeJS for backends,
      scripting and other services)

      * Rust (Nannou, egui)

      * C++ (especially openFrameworks, but also Arduino/Platform.IO)

      * Python (for Machine Learning training and inference, also TouchDesigner
      scripting)

      * Java (mostly in the context of Processing)


      ## Software Applications and Services


      * VSCode, Zed

      * Warp Terminal + ZSH

      * Git, GitHub

      * Ableton Live

      * Adobe Audition, Premiere

      * Rhino 7

      * Xcode

      * ffmpeg

      * Figma, Sketch, PhotoShop

      * MadMapper

      * Datadog (analytics, monitoring)


      ## Hardware


      ### Electronics and sensors


      * Microcontrollers: Arduino, ESP32, Pi Pico

      * Cameras: webcams, industrial imaging (e.g. FLIR, Basler), infrared,
      thermal

      * 1D and 2D LIDAR (range-finding, mapping, tracking)

      * Proximity and presence detection (RADAR, PIR, sonar)

      * Depth cameras, e.g. Kinect, Luxonis OAK-D, Leap Motion

      * IMU (accelerometers, gyros, etc.)


      ### Lights, sound, screens


      * LED control, DMX lighting (pixel mapping, movable fixtures)

      * Screens of all kinds: LED walls, projectors, etc.

      * Media servers, show control systems

      * Multi-speaker audio systems

      * MIDI controllers


      ### Other


      * 3D printing (especially for enclosures, mounting solutions)

      * Networking (configuration, routers, remote proxies, WiFi, servers)

      * Custom PCs (preferably Linux)

      * Single-board computers, e.g. Raspberry Pi and Nvidia Jetson
      (Nano/Xavier)
