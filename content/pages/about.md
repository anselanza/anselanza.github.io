      # Favourite Programming Languages and Technologies


      * TypeScript (React especially on the frontend, NodeJS for backends,
      scripting and other services)

      * [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for bundling

      * Rust ([Nannou](https://nannou.cc/ "nannou"), egui)

      * C++ (especially [openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/ "oF"), but
      also Arduino/Platform.IO)

      * Python (for Machine Learning training and inference, also TouchDesigner
      scripting)

      * Java (mostly in the context of [Processing](https://processing.org/
      "Processing"))

      * Linux and Docker

      * WebGL+GLSL shaders, but I'm learning [W(eb)GPU](https://wgpu.rs/
      "WGPU")+WGLSL fast as I can


      # Favourite Software Applications and Services


      * VSCode, [Zed](https://zed.dev/ "Zed")

      * [Warp Terminal](https://www.warp.dev/ "Warp") + ZSH

      * Git, GitHub, [LazyGit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit)

      * TouchDesigner, [Cables.GL](https://cables.gl/)


      # Hardware


      ### Electronics and sensors


      * Microcontrollers: Arduino, ESP32, Pi Pico (RP2040)

      * Cameras: webcams, industrial imaging (e.g. FLIR, Basler), infrared,
      thermal

      * 1D and 2D LIDAR (range-finding, mapping, tracking)

      * Proximity and presence detection (RADAR, PIR, sonar)

      * Depth cameras, e.g. Kinect, [Luxonis
      OAK-D](https://shop.luxonis.com/products/oak-d), Leap Motion

      * IMU (accelerometers, gyros, etc.)


      ### Lights, sound, screens


      * LED control, DMX lighting (pixel mapping, movable fixtures)

      * Screens of all kinds: LED walls, projectors, etc.

      * Media servers, show control systems

      * Multi-speaker audio systems

      * MIDI controllers


      ### Other


      * 3D printing (especially for enclosures, mounting solutions)

      * Networking (configuration, routers, remote proxies, WiFi, servers)

      * Custom PCs (preferably Linux, definitely
      [Pop\_OS!](https://pop.system76.com/) in spite of its silly name)

      * Single-board computers, e.g. Raspberry Pi and [Nvidia
      Jetson](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/)
      (Nano/Xavier)
