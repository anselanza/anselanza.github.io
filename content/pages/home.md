      I have had many roles and titles, but they all come down to this: **making
      wonderful things using technology**.


      At the moment, my title is Creative Technologist, which means a lot of
      different things to different people. What it means to me is that I have
      been able to explore and combine a wide variety of technology
      specialisations. I've also become really good at helping ambitious teams
      find pragmatic solutions.


      The projects you will see here often feature high-minded concepts and
      beautiful aesthetics, but please don't miss that **behind all this is
      carefully-crafted, robust software**. I'd love to help you tackle new
      challenges and deliver superb results!

          I learn fast and come up with solutions. I have worked in teams of
          creative professionals for almost 20 years, and I know how to find
          pragmatic approaches for ambitious and high-imagination projects.

          My specialty is web development, but also Rust and NodeJS. I'm
          comfortable with Machine Learning, programming microcontrollers and
          network infrastructure. I love finding (or building) excellent tools
          to help others excel.

        text: >-
          I have deep expertise in immersive installations, events and media
          technology: screens, lights, cameras, sound, generative graphics and
          sensors. That translates into a wealth of knowledge on UX, high
          performance hardware, iterative software development and high
          availability systems.
