      I'm a **software engineer** with unconventional career experience. I know
      how to **make impossible things possible **- as solo developer or (even
      better) with great teams.


      I have had many roles and titles, but they all come down to this: **making
      wonderful things using technology**.


      The projects you will see here often feature high-minded concepts and
      beautiful aesthetics, but please don't miss that **behind all this is
      carefully-crafted, robust software**. I'd love to help you tackle new
      challenges and deliver superb results.

          I learn fast and come up with solutions. I have worked in teams of
          creative professionals for almost 20 years, and I know how to find
          pragmatic approaches for ambitious and high-imagination projects.

          My specialty is web development, but also Rust and NodeJS. I'm
          comfortable with Machine Learning, programming microcontrollers and
          network infrastructure. I love finding (or building) excellent tools
          to help others excel.

        text: >-
          I have deep expertise in immersive installations, events and media
          technology: screens, lights, cameras, sound, generative graphics and
          sensors. That translates into a wealth of knowledge on UX, high
          performance hardware, iterative software development and high
          availability systems.
