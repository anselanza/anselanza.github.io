      I have had many roles and titles, but they all come down to this: **making
      wonderful things using technology**.


      At the moment, my title is "Creative Technologist". Does that mean “a
      designer with some hacky coding skills”? Fortunately, that doesn't really
      describe what I do. I have the software engineering capabilities and
      in-depth experience required to turn big ideas, no matter how ambitious,
      into pragmatic reality.

          I learn fast and come up with solutions. I have worked in teams of
          creative professionals for almost 20 years, and I know how to find
          pragmatic approaches for high-imagination projects.

          My specialty is web development, but also Rust and NodeJS. I'm
          comfortable with Machine Learning, microcontrollers or visual
          programming environments.

          If it has screens, lights, cameras, sound, generative graphics or
          sensors, I'm interested. I have deep expertise in immersive
          installations, events and media technology.
