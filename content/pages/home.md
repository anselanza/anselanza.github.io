      I call myself a Creative Technologist. 


      Does that mean “a designer with some hacky coding skills”? Not in my case.


      I have the software engineering capabilities and in-depth experience
      required to turn creative ideas into pragmatic reality.

          I learn fast and come up with solutions. I have worked in teams of
          creative professionals for almost 20 years, and I know how to find
          pragmatic approaches for high-imagination projects.

          If it has screens, lights, cameras, sound, generative graphics or
          sensors, I'm interested. I have deep expertise in immersive
          installations, events and media technology.
